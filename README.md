**Introduction**

Motivated and multi-faceted Junior Software Engineer. After my employer went into administration and being made redundant in March 2020, I decided to focus all of my time and energy into becoming a better developer - now I am on the search for new and exciting opportunities.

I can understand the development lifecycle in depth and am confident in all aspects of development from writing clean test driven code, through to domain modelling,documentation and maintenance. I am a fast learner and extremely enthusiastic about technology and digital products. My industry experience in E-commerce, Content Management Systems, Atomic Design and Headless Architecture would prove valuable to any business.

**Background**

After 6+ years in the tech industry, this provided key commercial experience and developed vast transferable skills such as communication, teamwork, and organisation. Such examples are in addition to the technical programming skills gained at Makers Academy and General Assembly. I am familiar with working in tech teams from both a Software Engineering and Agile delivery stance, this I feel gives me a unique ability to add value to a business.

**Objective**

I'm looking to work for an organisation where I can make a meaningful contribution, learn a lot and have a positive impact on team success. I am a fast learner, and I am willing and enthusiastic to learn new technology stacks and skills. 

**Key Technologies**

JavaScript (ES6), React, Node.js, Express, Sinatra, Git workflow, SASS, CSS, HTML.

## Technical Skills:

- JavaScript, Node and React - I have a variety of projects using full stack capabilities and comfortable tackling efforts solo or working in collaborative groups
- RESTful APIs - I am able to build using REST to send and receive requests
- TDD approach - Makers Academy taught me the importance of honing a test drive approach in order to test functionality and behavior first, whilst maintaining high code coverage via unit tests and acceptance tests.
- Object Orientated Programming - Able to write code by breaking the objects into classes and methods/functions.
- Debugging - I have a calm and rational approach to debugging, by gaining visibility of the bug, and tightening the loop until this is fixed.
- Documentation writing - I am able to write clear and concise documentation for anything I write, allowing for the next developer to understand the code

**Maintenance and pipeline instrumentation** - I have deployed my individual projects using Github Marketplace actions
- Codacy (checks code quality)
- Synk (checks for security vulnerabilities)
- Dependabot (automates dependancy updates)

At Beamly I have previously used:
- GoCD (piple instrumentation)
- Fastly (cache management)
- AWS: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) (cloud-computing platform)

**Passionate about UI** During my time at Beamly my strengths were in being able to take a visual design in sketch, and transforming this into a fully functioning website/campaign page through Javascript, React and HTML/CSS, with pixel perfect precision. I collaborated well with the UX team and was able to help meet the delivery deadlines which delighted clients. 


**Keen eye for code detail** Whilst replatforming the legacy websites from Wordpress to React, this required redirecting legacy URLS to the new URLs. This taught me about regular expressions as all redirects were implemented through a JSON file, and required a keen eye for detail. Additionally this was sometimes in Russian or Chinese so required special attention.

**Accessibility** - After Topshop was sued for lack of accessibility in 2018, this was due to alt images not having appropriate 'alt' tags and and colour contrasting below satisfactory standards, I suggested to the next company I worked for that this be addressed in order to avoid any legal issues in future.

**Performance** - Whilst running site tests at Arcadia, I spotted that the images provided by the Design teams were very big and slowed site performance down. I suggested we reduce the imagery size (whilst not compromising quality) for faster site performance. This improved the website load speed by 50%, and could be seen on the Network tab.

**UAT testing, A/B testing** - Whilst working at Arcadia, I was running site analytics on Adobe Omniture (homepage tracking report) and noticed that the homepage hero's second and third image on the slider was not generating many clicks, therefore no traffic was reaching those pages. We decided to run A/B testing to see if the website homepage could be improved, I coded a few different examples and the analytics proved over the coming months that this was the right decision as the visitors preferred to see all imagery upon landing on the homepage.

**Mobile first mentality** - When building a website for a new client, I used my knowledge gained from General assembly and when queried on how to mobile optimise, I suggested we as developers use a triple nested flexbox as the design was in a grid-like format so would be the best approach. This was because I had noticed that 80% of the audience was mobile users, so Mobile first decisions should be at the forefront of decision making and flexbox allowed this. We built the website using mobile first and it launched in 2019.

### General Assembly - [Front End Development](https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development/london)
 
<div align="right">October 2018 - December 2019</div>

A 10 week part time course where I learnt to build responsive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — using a versatile skill set with powerful applications. This course kick started my career change and I was able to transfer from a Delivery Management role to a Software Engineering role at the company I was working for at the time. 

### [APMG](https://apmg-international.com/) - Agile Project Management  ® [Foundation and Practitioner](https://apmg-international.com/product/agile-project-management-agilepmr) 

The course equipped me with offers a practical and repeatable methodology that achieves an ideal balance between the standards, rigour and visibility required for good project management, and the fast-pace, change and empowerment provided by Agile.

### University of Leeds - [Digital Media](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/g856/digital-media-ba) (2010 - 2013) 

<div align="right">September 2010 - July 2013</div>

- **Final Major Project:** As a student, I found it difficult to find adhoc jobs in my local area to help make ends meet. I created a website using PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS which hosted jobs postings by employers, and students could sign up using their university email address and apply to jobs via a jobs board. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/Joanneyoung01/university-final-year-project).
- **Core subjects:** History of the Web, Interface design, Accessibility, Project Delivery and Technical Coding modules. I selected PHP, SQL, Javacript, and HTML/CSS as my focussed technical languages.

**Kesteven and Grantham Girls School** - A levels in Business, Media, Theatre and Dance.

## Soft Skills:

**Communication and social skills:** I pride myself of being a 'peoples person'. My commercial experience provided me with the foundations for clear and concise communication with internal and external teams. I was able to communicate with teams regarding the day to day business with internal project/product managers, UX and QA teams, as well as stakeholders on status updates and showcasing the product build. Relaying what can sometimes be technical jargon into layman's terms was an important skill as it allowed for clear communication and cross-function collaboration.

**Presenting to large and small audiences** - In my last role I would regularly present project/product launches at the weekly company wide (London HQ, New York, Paris and Brazil) 'show and tell meetings', this developed my presenting skills and I gained confidence in speaking to large crowds.

**Adapatable** - The scope for a project would often change, as per clients needs. For example, in 2019 we had 2 weeks to deliver a new website for the Max Factor Swedish market, this had press attached to it so the deadline fixed. As the clients needs changed due to a change in branding, the engineering team's priorities changed in order to accommodate this. This taught me to be adaptable in the face of change, and not to be precious about code.

### Technical Blogging

My blog where all of my Makers Academy was documented can be found on my blog [here](https://medium.com/@joanneyoung_).

### Hackathons
Once a quarter my I participate in company Hackathons. The last Hackathon as a team of 4 we built a tool to help make reading company documents a fun experience. This was a website where as a user, so that they can view goals and objectives for the following quarter in a fun and interactive way, the app would display any given document using common slang, as oppose to formal language. This was built using a find and replace script which was built in Javascript. We won top project of the day out of 20 teams, and won £1000 to spend at a restaurant of our choice.


## Hobbies and Interests
- I love staying fit and healthy by going to the gym. I am a member at At Your Beat Dance Studio and Base Dance studios, where I go to dance classes a few times a week. I also like to mix this up with Yoga and Pilates.
- I reguarly go to tech events in London, such as Codebar and Developher when I meet and network with others in similar industries. Since lock down I have been going to the Developher virtual meet ups.
- I volunteer for a charity - Re-engage ([www.reengage.org.uk](http://www.reengage.org.uk/)). This is a charity which connects volunteers to older citizens in the local community (usually 75+) in a bid to tackle loneliness and isolation among the elders. The group coordinator role is to organise tea parties for a small group of elders on a monthly basis on weekends. My final project at Makers was based on my volunteer work.
- I have always been one for getting involved in multiple aspects of company life from social committees to Corporate Social Responsibility societies. I have been part of every social committee for every company I have worked for, even stemming back to university life where I was on the social secretary for the Leeds University Cheerleaders.

**Fun fact: I am a qualified scuba diver**


### What I am working on now? ###
I have a keen interest in Typescript, so I am currently building a project with the focus of learning this language as after reading blog articles about the security benefits (particularly on large code bases) of Typescript.
